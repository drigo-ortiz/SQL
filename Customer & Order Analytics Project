SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers;
--we can see that some cells have "..." and some simply state the words "Order ID"
--Ensure to write WHERE order_id <> ‘ ‘ AND order_id <> ‘Order ID’ when calling that column

--#1) How many orders were placed in January? 
--Remember to filter out the blank and incorrect order IDs like we did in the 
--"dealing with messy data" section of the previous lesson!

SELECT COUNT(orderid)

--#2) How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

--#3) Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
